The time, a pleasant Sunday afternoon in the early autumn of 1861. The place, a forest's heart in the mountain region of southwestern Virginia. Private Grayrock of the Federal Army is discovered seated comfortably at the root of a great pine tree, against which he leans, his legs extended straight along the ground, his rifle lying across his thighs, his hands 
clasped in order that they may not fall away 
to his sides resting upon the barrel of the weapon.
The contact of the back of his head
with the tree has pushed his cap downward
over his eyes, almost concealing them; one
seeing him would say that he slept.
Private Grayrock did not sleep; to 
have done so would have imperiled the interests 
of the United States, for he was a long way outside
the lines and subject to capture or death at the hands
of the enemy. Moreover, he was in a frame of mind unfavorable
to repose. The cause of his perturbation of spirit was this:
during the previous night he had served on the picket-guard,
and had been posted as a sentinel in this very forest.
